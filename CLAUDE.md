# CLAUDE.md — Rokugan Persistent World

## What This Project Is
An online persistent world set in Rokugan (Legend of the Five Rings, 4th Edition).
The simulation runs continuously server-side whether players are connected or not.
Players connect to a living world — they do not host or drive it.
All gameplay resolves through L5R 4th Edition rules (Roll and Keep dice system).

## Engine and Language
- Godot 4.6.2-stable
- GDScript (typed where possible — always annotate variables and return types)
- Networking is NOT in scope yet — do not scaffold multiplayer, RPC, or
  ENet/WebSocket systems until explicitly instructed

## The GDD Is the Authoritative Source
All game mechanics are in /gdd/ as markdown files.
The master index is at /gdd/00_INDEX.md — read it before asking what exists.

**If a mechanic is not in a LOCKED section, do not implement it.**
Sections marked DEFERRED or Reference/No tags are not ready for code.
Never extrapolate from one system to another (e.g. land combat rules to naval
combat, one school's technique to another's). If the GDD is silent, stop and ask.

When implementing any system, read its LOCKED section directly from /gdd/.
Do not rely on summaries, cross-references, or inference. LOCKED sections win.

## Directory Structure
```
/gdd/           — GDD markdown files (read-only reference, never edit)
/autoload/      — Godot Autoloads / singletons — registered in Project Settings
/simulation/    — Headless simulation logic: NPC engine, resource tick,
                  world event resolution. NO Node inheritance here.
                  Plain GDScript classes only (class_name, no extends Node).
/shared/        — Data models: CharacterData, ProvinceData, etc.
                  Use Resource subclasses for serialisable data.
/client/        — Player-facing Godot scenes (UI, ASCII map display, etc.)
                  Nothing in /client/ should contain simulation logic.
/tests/         — GUT unit tests. Mirror the /simulation/ and /shared/
                  directory structure inside /tests/.
```

## GDScript Conventions
- Always use static typing: `var x: int`, `func foo(a: String) -> bool:`
- Use `class_name` on every file that defines a reusable type
- Simulation classes must NOT extend Node. They are plain objects.
  Correct:  `class_name ResourceTick` (no extends)
  Wrong:    `class_name ResourceTick extends Node`
- Use `const` for lookup tables and enum-equivalent dictionaries
- Prefer `enum` blocks for NeedType, ActionID, DispositionTier, WoundLevel, etc.
- Autoloads are the only global singletons — do not use static variables as
  a substitute for proper singleton registration
- Never put simulation logic inside a scene's _ready() or _process().
  Scenes call into /simulation/ — simulation does not call into scenes.

## Testing (GUT)
- GUT (Godot Unit Testing) is the test framework. Tests live in /tests/.
- The dice engine must have passing GUT tests before any other system uses it.
- Every pure simulation function must be testable with no scene tree present.
- Test file naming: `test_<system_name>.gd` mirroring the source file.
- Do not couple test setup to Autoloads — pass dependencies explicitly.

## Hard Constraints — Never Violate Without Asking
- PC death is permanent. No resurrection mechanic of any kind.
- Jade counters Jigoku only. No effect on other spirit realms.
- Any maho use raises PTL whether detected or not.
- The simulation does not pause for absent players.
- NPCs never use the ASCII map unless a PC is personally present.
  NPC-only resolution goes through the dice engine, not map generation.
- CrimeRecord exists at world level. The system always knows who committed
  the crime. Investigation is players discovering what the system knows.
- met_characters, hostile tag, provocation flag, zone_event_log,
  operational_superior_id, spell_intent tag, and weapon material tag are
  cross-cutting constraints. Read their authoritative sections before writing
  any code that reads or writes these fields.
- One topic per piece of information. One topic per death. One topic per event.
- Dead characters always carry NEUTRAL subject_role valence.
- Spirit realms are not evil except Jigoku. Do not implement jade as a
  general-purpose spirit ward.

## What's Been Built So Far

All systems below are implemented, tested, and passing. They follow the
single-dice-entry-point and server-authoritative constraints.

### Core Dice & Stats Layer
- **simulation/dice_engine.gd** — THE single authoritative rolling entry point.
  `roll_and_keep()` with exploding 10s, L5R4e 10-dice cap (overflow = +2 per
  excess die), emphasis rerolls. `roll_skill_check()` handles unskilled
  (no explode). `roll_check()`, `contested_roll()`, `roll_initiative()`,
  `roll_damage()`. Seedable RNG for deterministic testing.
- **simulation/dice_result.gd** — DiceResult data class (kept_dice,
  dropped_dice, total, explosions, overflow_bonus).
- **simulation/character_stats.gd** — Pure static functions: `get_ring_value()`
  (min of two traits, Void single), `get_insight()` (rings×10 + skill ranks),
  `get_insight_rank()` (Rank 2 at 150, +25 per rank), `get_armor_tn()`,
  `get_wound_level()`, `get_wound_penalty()`, `is_dead()`.

### Combat & Consequence Systems
- **simulation/wound_system.gd** — `apply_damage()` with armor reduction,
  `heal_wounds()` (dead can't heal), `apply_falling_damage()` (1k1 per 2 tiles).
- **simulation/honor_glory_system.gd** — Honor/Glory/Status/Infamy changes
  clamped 0–10, court honor modifier (−2 to +2), full event table constants,
  atonement system per GDD s4.6.

### Skill & Action Economy
- **simulation/skill_resolver.gd** — Bridge between CharacterData and DiceEngine.
  SKILL_TRAITS dict mapping all L5R4e skills to governing traits.
  SUB_SKILL_TRAIT_OVERRIDES for specializations. `resolve_skill_check()` and
  `resolve_contested_check()` handle trait lookup, rank, emphasis, wound penalty
  automatically.
- **simulation/action_point_system.gd** — 2 AP per IC day, 8 per real day,
  no carryover. `reset_daily_ap()`, `spend_ap()`, `can_spend()`.

### Time
- **simulation/time_system.gd** — 1 tick = 1 IC day = 6 real hours. 360 days/year,
  12 months of 30. Seasons: Spring 90d, Summer 90d, Autumn 60d, Winter 120d.

### Data Models
- **shared/character_data.gd** — `L5RCharacterData` Resource. Full character sheet
  per GDD s22.3. Named L5RCharacterData (not CharacterData) to avoid conflict
  with pre-existing VtM code in scripts/characters/.
- **shared/enums.gd** — Ring, Trait, WoundLevel, Stance, SchoolType, ContextFlag,
  BushidoVirtue, ShouridoVirtue, RING_TRAITS, WOUND_PENALTIES,
  CommitmentType, CommitmentStatus, DeploymentStatus, ZoneSubtype (24 values),
  LordRank, TattooBodyLocation (9), TattooQualityTier, TattooSubjectType,
  TattooAbility (26 named abilities), CulturalReluctance, MilitaryRank (8 ranks),
  OperationalHierarchyType, KolatSect (7 sects), ShipClass (7 classes).
- **shared/province_data.gd** — ProvinceData Resource: terrain, adjacency,
  resources (rice/koku/iron/arms), population PU breakdown, stability. Data model
  only — no map generation (map is being worked on separately by the user).
- **shared/settlement_data.gd** — SettlementData Resource: 12 settlement types,
  infrastructure array, garrison, population.

### NPC Decision Engine
- **simulation/npc_data_structures.gd** — ImmediateNeed (generic target system),
  ScoredAction (8 scoring components with `get_total_score()`), ContextSnapshot,
  ProvinceStatus, competence modifier table per GDD s55.3/s55.5.
- **simulation/npc_decision_engine.gd** — Full 7-phase loop per GDD s55.4:
  1. Build Context — assembles ContextSnapshot from character + world state
  2. Resolve Goal — priority cascade: reactive > crisis > primary > standing > REST
  3. Generate Options — context-flag-specific action lists
  4. Personality Filter — hard removal by bushido/shourido virtue
  5. Score All — 8 components (objective alignment, disposition, personality lean,
     competence, urgency, standing influence, topic position, resource modifier)
  6. Selection — highest score, tiebreakers: ObjAlign > disposition > lower AP > seed
  7. Execution — AP deduction, action record returned
  Scoring helpers reference 8 JSON scoring tables via ScoringTableLoader.
  Full context generators with complete ActionID lists per ContextFlag.
  Objective decomposition routes through ObjectiveDecomposer.

### JSON Scoring Tables & Loader
- **simulation/scoring_table_loader.gd** — Loads and caches 8 JSON tables from
  `systems/npc_engine/data/tables/`. `load_all()`, `get_table()`,
  `get_scoring_tables()`, `get_filter_data()`.
- **systems/npc_engine/data/tables/** — 8 JSON files:
  objective_alignment (82 NeedTypes), personality_lean (14 virtues),
  personality_filter (bushido/shourido blocks), action_skill_map (76+ ActionIDs),
  competence_table (ranks 0-10), disposition_tiers (8 tiers),
  urgency_rules (10 rules), topic_position_alignment.

### Objective Decomposition
- **simulation/objective_decomposer.gd** — Routes standing objectives to
  type-specific decomposition trees per GDD s55.22/s55.24/s55.25.
  Political (6), Economic (5), Personal (8), Military (2) standing objectives.
  Stateless per GDD s55.4.2. Unknown NeedTypes pass through unchanged.

### Action Execution & World Mutation
- **simulation/action_executor.gd** — Routes chosen ActionIDs to SkillResolver
  dice rolls. Social/covert/military/admin categories with disposition-based TN
  modifiers. Returns effects dict (disposition_change, glory_change, info_gained,
  province effects).
- **simulation/effect_applicator.gd** — Applies executor results to world state.
  `apply()` mutates character disposition/honor/glory, province stability/garrison/
  report date, and appends to action_log. `apply_day_results()` batch processes
  a full day's results.

### Multi-NPC Wave Resolution
- **simulation/npc_wave_resolver.gd** — `resolve_day()` handles full day
  resolution per GDD s55.13. Reactive events first, then AP waves.
  Status-descending order, Awareness tiebreak. Lord dual-pool.
  `resolve_day_full()` adds execution (dice rolls + effects).
  `resolve_day_applied()` closes the full loop: decision → execution → mutation.

### Information System
- **simulation/information_system.gd** — Knowledge management per GDD s55.12,
  s55.7, s55.6. Five sources (Direct Observation, Daily Conversation, Letters,
  Intelligence Actions, Public Knowledge). Confidence decay: Fresh → Recent →
  Stale (disposition entries never decay). Probe visibility reads action_log to
  reveal target's recent actions. Contact discovery via court observation and
  introductions. Objective knowledge transfer copies relevant entries on
  assignment. CharacterData gains `knowledge_pool` and `known_contacts_by_clan`.

### Day Orchestrator
- **simulation/day_orchestrator.gd** — Single `advance_day()` entry point that
  advances world state by one IC day. Sequence: reset AP → NPCWaveResolver
  `resolve_day_applied()` (decision + execution + mutation) → process info events
  (Probe results wired into InformationSystem) → on season boundary: run
  ResourceTick + decay all characters' knowledge confidence.

### Resource Tick System
- **simulation/resource_tick.gd** — Seasonal resource processing per GDD s4.3.
  Rice consumption/harvest, starvation stages, 5-tier tax cascade,
  personality tax modifiers, iron/koku production, population growth.

### Approach Evaluation (s55.30)
- **simulation/approach_evaluation.gd** — Measure-Then-Decide system.
  Measurement pressure (high-roll-no-effect detection), approach assessment
  tags (EFFECTIVE/CAPPED/INEFFECTIVE), penalty registry with seasonal decay.
  Scoring modifier: +15 measurement bonus, −15 approach penalty (halved after
  1 season, cleared after 2), +10 alternative bonus. NOT YET WIRED into
  NPC Phase 5 scoring — standalone tested only.

### Commitment Registry (s55.31)
- **simulation/commitment_registry.gd** — Six commitment types, consequence
  tables for 4 breaking modes × 3 tiers. Force majeure with personality-
  modified retroactive forgiveness. Phase 5 at-risk penalties (−5/−15/−25
  by tier, cap −40). NOT YET WIRED into NPC Phase 5 scoring.
- **shared/commitment_data.gd** — CommitmentData Resource.

### Military Hierarchy (s57.21)
- **simulation/military_hierarchy.gd** — Five-level org chain queries:
  Company → Legion → Section → Army → Clan. Deployment management,
  commander vacancy detection, operational superior resolution.
  CLAN_ARMY_COUNT: Crab=4, Crane=2, Dragon=2, Lion=4, Mantis=3,
  Phoenix=1, Scorpion=1, Unicorn=3, Imperial=1.
- **shared/military_unit_data.gd** — CompanyData, LegionData, SectionData,
  ArmyData inner classes (all extend Resource).

### Zone Flag Matrix (s57.36)
- **simulation/zone_flag_matrix.gd** — 24 zone subtypes with 8 boolean flags
  each (performance_permitted, wall_art_slot, displayed_art_slot, fusuma_slot,
  tokonoma, bonsai_display_slot, garden_eligible, shrine_eligible). Castle
  scaling by lord rank (Village Headman 1–2 through Imperial 10–11).

### Tattoo System (s57.25)
- **simulation/tattoo_system.gd** — Both decorative artisanal tattoos AND
  Togashi ability tattoos. Cultural reluctance gates by clan/family with
  disposition thresholds. APPLY_TATTOO quality resolution (AP 2–6, TN 15–35,
  skill gates, raise upgrades). Disposition bonds (permanent bidirectional
  +1 to +5). Visibility computation per body location and clothing state.
  Togashi school allotments (Tattooed Order 6, Kikage Zumi 3, Hoshi 2).
  Decorative gate for monk schools. SEEK_TATTOO urgency scaling and BLOCKED
  state. Commission system. Provenance investigation. World gen helpers.
- **shared/tattoo_data.gd** — TattooData Resource (9 body locations).

### Character Sheet Field Index (s57.35)
- **shared/character_data.gd** — Consolidated all fields from gap sections:
  military_rank, commanded_unit_id, assigned_company_id (s11.3.18),
  legal_cases (s11.3.14), void_refresh_blocked_until (s57.32),
  kolat_superior_id/kolat_sect (s54.7c), hunt_trophies (s57.38),
  trained_companions (s57.39), aboard_ship_id/passage_request_count_today/
  assigned_ship_id (s57.42), tattoo ability state fields (s57.25.11),
  is_bald. operational_hierarchy_type upgraded from String to enum.

### What's Next
1. Military standing objectives — GDD s55.23 decomposition trees (awaiting content)
2. Topic propagation — momentum tracking, public knowledge broadcast per GDD s16
3. Daily conversation / letter information exchange per GDD s55.12
4. Crime record and investigation system per GDD s57.47, s57.16

### Systems Awaiting NPC Loop Integration
The following systems are fully implemented and tested but NOT YET WIRED into
the NPC decision engine's Phase 5 scoring or the DayOrchestrator loop:
- **ApproachEvaluation** — provides measurement bonus, approach penalty, and
  alternative bonus modifiers for Phase 5 scoring
- **CommitmentRegistry** — provides at-risk penalties for Phase 5 scoring,
  plus deadline checking and consequence application
- **TravelCommitment** — provides redirect penalties and sublocation access
  gates (travel oscillation prevention)
- **CrimeSystem** — consequence tables exist but no hook connects action
  execution to crime recording; covert action `detection_risk` is produced
  by ActionExecutor but never routed to crime discovery
- **MilitaryHierarchy** — unit chain queries exist but military ActionIDs
  don't consult the hierarchy during execution
- **ZoneFlagMatrix** — zone-level flags not connected to context generation
  or action availability checks

## Open Design Decisions
The following architectural issues were identified during audit and need
human decision before implementation:

### 1. Topic Identity: String vs int
`L5RCharacterData.topic_pool` is `Array[String]` (slugs like "crane_scandal"),
but `TopicData.topic_id` is `int` and `ContextSnapshot.known_topics` is
`Array[int]`. The NPC engine uses int IDs while conversation/letter systems
use string slugs. These cannot interoperate without a translation layer.
**Decision needed:** Standardise on int IDs everywhere (requires migrating
topic_pool and letter system), or on string slugs (requires migrating
TopicData and ContextSnapshot), or build an explicit lookup Dictionary?

### 2. Timestamp Sentinel Convention: 0 vs -1
Some "never happened" fields use `0` (e.g. `last_medicine_treatment_ic_day`,
`void_refresh_blocked_until`) and others use `-1` (e.g.
`phoenix_last_used_ic_day`, `ocean_last_used_ooc_day`). Since IC day 0 is
the first valid game day, `0` is ambiguous as "never." **Decision needed:**
Standardise on `-1` for all "never happened" int timestamps? Or define day 0
as invalid (game starts at day 1)?

### 3. CommitmentData Redundant Fields
`source_action_id` and `created_by_action` on CommitmentData are always set
to the same value in `create_commitment()`. **Decision needed:** Remove one
of them, or do they serve distinct purposes that will diverge later?

### 4. knowledge_pool Typing
`L5RCharacterData.knowledge_pool: Array[Dictionary]` is heavily used by
InformationSystem with ~6 known keys per entry. Should this become a typed
Resource subclass (KnowledgeEntry) for safety, or stay as Dictionary for
flexibility?

## What To Do When Uncertain
Stop. Read the relevant LOCKED section in /gdd/. If it does not answer the
question, say so explicitly — do not guess, do not fill gaps with plausible
logic, do not extrapolate from adjacent systems.
